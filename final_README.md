## Project Description
This project aims to provide an understanding of Opportunity Youth (OY) are in South King County, Washington, including which areas have the highest amount of OY, what possible factors affect the amount of OY in a given area, whether OY is increasing or decreasing and where these trends are occurring. We pull data from [Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/pums/about.html) 5 year data files for 2014, 2017, and 2018. Our goal is to show where public assistance programs will be most effective, both in regards to OY demographics and the geographical regions in which those OY reside.

## Needs of this project

- Data exploration/descriptive statistics
- Data processing/cleaning
- Statistical modeling
- Data collection (We would like to add 2016 and 2017 PUMS data)
